                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Strategic Orchestration</h3>
                    <p>I believe great design leadership happens at the intersection of user needs, business strategy, and technical feasibility. I spend time understanding the broader business context so I can position design as a strategic driver, not just a service function.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Team Development Through Challenge</h3>
                    <p>The best way to develop team members is through meaningful, challenging work that stretches their capabilities. I actively create opportunities for designers to work on high-visibility projects that directly support their career growth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
                    <p>Complex enterprise platforms require thinking beyond individual features. I focus on how design decisions create coherent experiences across multiple touchpoints and user journeys, always considering the broader ecosystem impact.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Proactive Remote Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Remote design leadership requires intentional communication and relationship building. I thrive in distributed environments by being proactive in stakeholder management, clear in asynchronous communication, and focused on building engaged, cohesive teams across time zones.</p>

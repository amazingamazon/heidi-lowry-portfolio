            <h2>AI-Powered Solution Development Platform</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Transforming how businesses build custom AI solutions through strategic design leadership</p>
            
            <div class="challenge">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Businesses were forcing SaaS products to fit their needs instead of getting custom AI solutions. Our platform had all the pieces – Processes, Workflows, Apps, Forms, Data, and Document Generation – but they weren't working together to give AI the business context it needed.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Approach</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Identifying the Market Opportunity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Understood gap where businesses needed custom AI solutions</li>
                <li>Leveraged our platform's unique advantage: combining all capabilities to provide AI with rich business context</li>
                <li>Positioned us for competitive differentiation in AI-powered business solutions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. Establishing Human-AI Partnership Principles</h4>
            <div class="key-insight">
                "The hardest part isn't the AI generation—it's designing the right amount of AI output that humans can meaningfully review and act on."
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Challenged industry assumption that "AI should do everything"</li>
                <li>Established principle: AI generates, humans guide</li>
                <li>Designed granular interaction patterns for different personas without cognitive overload</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Leading Through Complexity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Management:</strong> Guided C-suite presentations and provided real-time meeting direction</li>
                <li><strong>Team Protection:</strong> Defended small, empowered teams to ensure streamlined leadership understanding and prevent scope creep</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Partnership:</strong> Collaborated with engineering to ensure designs matched AI capabilities possible to deliver</li>
                <li><strong>User Focus:</strong> Maintained continuous learning loop despite rapid AI technology changes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            
            <h4>Discovery & Alignment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Built continuous feedback loop with internal and external users</li>
                <li>Balanced quick ideation for stakeholder alignment with engineering feasibility</li>
                <li>Created shared vision across multiple senior stakeholders</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Strategy to Execution</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Elevated established senior designer to higher-visibility role, coaching them through executive presentations</li>
                <li>Championed designer's ideas and created space for them to focus wholly on AI exploration</li>
                <li>Mentored designer through executive stakeholder management, positioning them for promotion</li>
                <li>Set team workloads and negotiated scope with PM to shape realistic roadmaps</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Key Design Decisions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adaptive AI interaction modes:</strong> Combined chat-style AI for open-ended exploration, inline AI for contextual assistance, and quick manual edits for finishing touches – matching users' mental models as projects evolve from ambiguous to refined</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive personalization strategy:</strong> Created different entry points for technical vs. non-technical users, with plans for role-based prompts and customizable AI behavior to meet each persona where they are</li>
                <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop validation:</strong> Designed preview and validation steps that mimic peer collaboration, allowing early error detection and correction to prevent hallucination cascades and maintain user confidence</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p><strong>What I learned about leading AI design:</strong> The intersection of AI capabilities and human needs requires constant recalibration. Success came from protecting the team's focus while managing upward to keep stakeholders aligned.</p>
                <p><strong>What I'd do differently:</strong> Keep the team smaller and more focused from the start. Too many stakeholders got involved too early, making it hard to narrow scope and costing us valuable learning time through mid-development changes. Small, empowered teams with clear decision rights actually move faster.</p>

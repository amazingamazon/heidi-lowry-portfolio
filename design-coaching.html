                <p><strong>Development Opportunity:</strong> I had a talented mid-level designer ready for senior-level work. Rather than designing the solution myself, I used this modernization project as a coaching opportunity to develop her craft evaluation skills and strategic thinking.</p>

            <h4>Problems to Solve:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Outdated visual design doesn't align with modern platform aesthetic</li>
                <li>Bloated UI with excessive options creates cognitive load</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>My Coaching Approach</h3>

            <p>Instead of directing the designer toward a specific solution, I taught her to evaluate design options systematically using three lenses:</p>

            <div class="impact-grid">
                <div class="impact-item">
                    <h4>Visual Design Assessment</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How does visual hierarchy guide user attention?</li>
                        <li>Does spacing create natural scanning patterns?</li>
                        <li>Are interactive elements clearly afforded?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="impact-item">
                    <h4>Interaction Pattern Analysis</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How discoverable are key actions?</li>
                        <li>Does the pattern match user mental models?</li>
                        <li>What's the cognitive load at each step?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="impact-item">
                    <h4>User Impact Consideration</h4>

                        <li>Who does this serve well?</li>
                        <li>Who might struggle with this approach?</li>

            <h3>The Design Options</h3>

            <p>The designer explored two fundamentally different approaches. I coached her to create a systematic comparison that would help stakeholders understand the tradeoffs.</p>

                                <li>Clear visual hierarchy separates activity-level content from nested task/note details</li>
                                <li>Explicit button labels ("Add task", "Add note", image/file icons) provide clear affordances</li>
                                <li>Familiar "Add [content type]" pattern reduces learning curve for new users</li>

                                <li>Still rather rigid structure - is modernization enough to differentiate from legacy experience?</li>
                                <li>Visual weight distributed across many UI elements rather than focusing on primary actions</li>

                    <strong>User Impact:</strong> This approach serves conservative users transitioning from legacy systems (familiar patterns reduce change resistance) and new users who need scaffolding to understand available features. However, power users who want to work quickly without clicking through options may find the structure adds friction, and teams with simple documentation needs may feel the structure is over-engineered.

                <div class="key-insight">
                    <strong>User Impact:</strong> This approach serves new customers familiar with modern editing tools (immediate comfort with interaction patterns), users who want to document quickly without UI friction, and teams creating simple, narrative-style procedures without complex task hierarchies. However, users expecting explicit process structure (activities → tasks → notes) may struggle with the flexible format not enforcing this, teams needing consistency across documentation may see too much flexibility leading to varied patterns, and anyone without prior exposure to slash-command interfaces will face a completely hidden functionality crisis.
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Strategic Decision & Pivot</h3>

            <p>The team initially chose Option 1 (prescriptive approach) because our existing user base expected explicit process structure and we needed to minimize change resistance during the modernization.</p>

            <p>However, as the project progressed, our design system team began handling some of the interaction patterns we had planned to build. This changed the technical landscape and opened up new possibilities.</p>

            <div class="key-insight">
                <strong>Coaching Moment:</strong> Rather than seeing this as a setback, I coached the designer to view it as an opportunity to pivot strategically. We shifted focus to a map view visualization that leveraged the prescriptive structure in a new way—showing process flows visually rather than just in list form.
            </div>

            <p>The designer is currently iterating on the map view approach through user testing, applying the same systematic evaluation framework we established during the initial comparison.</p>

                <h3>Leadership Reflection</h3>
                <p><strong>On coaching through craft:</strong> The best way to develop senior-level designers is to teach them how to think systematically about design decisions, not just execute solutions. By creating evaluation frameworks together, I helped this designer build lasting analytical skills she now applies to every project.</p>
                <p><strong>On developing judgment, not just taste:</strong> Visual design isn't just about what looks good—it's about understanding why certain approaches serve certain users better than others. The side-by-side comparison forced explicit discussion of tradeoffs, which is exactly the kind of thinking senior designers need to demonstrate.</p>
                <p><strong>On strategic pivots:</strong> When the design system team's work changed our technical context, I coached the designer to see this as an opportunity rather than a disruption. Learning to adapt strategically while maintaining design vision is a critical senior-level skill.</p>
                <p><strong>Most importantly:</strong> This designer's promotion wasn't because she executed my vision—it was because she developed her own systematic approach to design evaluation that she'll carry throughout her career. That's the real measure of successful coaching.</p>

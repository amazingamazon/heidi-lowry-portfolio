                <h3>The Strategic Challenge</h3>
                <p>Process Manager was a powerful standalone product for documenting and managing business processes, but it was increasingly misaligned with our company's unified platform strategy. Users complained it looked outdated, was hard to navigate, and had slow loading speeds.</p>
                <p>The real challenge wasn't just modernizing the UI—it was transforming a siloed product into an integrated platform capability without losing existing customers or revenue, while opening new market opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Leadership Approach</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Long-term Strategic Partnership</h4>
            <p>Over 18 months, I evolved my thinking alongside our Lead PM from surface-level modernization to deep strategic transformation. Rather than focusing on easier-to-build features like dashboards, we identified that <strong>editing and visualizing processes</strong> was the core functionality that would differentiate us in the market.</p>
            
            <div class="key-insight">
                Key insight: Process documentation isn't just about compliance—it's the business context that makes AI solutions truly valuable across our entire platform.
            </div>
            
            <h4>2. Cross-Functional Research Integration</h4>
            <p>I worked closely with our Research team to evangelize their persona work, which revealed a critical strategic opportunity. Their updated persona research showed that Ana (Administrator) serves as connective tissue between Line of Business users and technical users—a role we had previously undervalued.</p>
            
            <h4>3. Phased Market Strategy</h4>
            <p>Rather than a big-bang redesign that could alienate existing customers, I developed a phased approach that protects existing ARR while growing new revenue streams:</p>

            <h4>4. Team Development Through Strategic Work</h4>
            <p>I'm mentoring a mid-level designer through senior-level work that directly feeds her promotion this year. Rather than designing the solution myself, I'm directing her to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrate AI into the redesign from the start (following patterns from our AI platform work)</li>
                <li>Modernize the experience using our Nintex Design System for platform cohesion</li>
                <li>Focus on core editing/visualization rather than peripheral features</li>
                <li>Think strategically about user migration paths and business impact</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Resource Allocation & Team Strategy</h4>
            <p>I'm currently working with PM and Engineering to break down the strategic vision into deliverable chunks for our team starting this quarter. With 1.5 FTE designers, I've divided their work to balance immediate delivery needs with long-term strategic vision.</p>
            
            <h4>Technical Leadership Decisions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI-First Integration:</strong> Directing AI integration from the start rather than retrofitting later</li>
                <li><strong>Design System Alignment:</strong> Ensuring platform cohesion through consistent patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Core Functionality Focus:</strong> Prioritizing process editing/visualization over easier peripheral features</li>
                <li><strong>Data Context Strategy:</strong> Leveraging Process Manager's rich textual data to enhance AI solutions across the platform</li>

                <h3>Leadership Reflection</h3>
                <p><strong>What this project taught me about strategic leadership:</strong> The most valuable transformations happen slowly, through consistent partnership and evolved thinking. Taking 18 months to evolve from surface-level modernization to deep strategic insight was time well spent.</p>
                <p><strong>My approach to team development:</strong> Rather than doing the work myself, I'm using this complex project to elevate my team member's capabilities. Her success on senior-level strategic work directly supports her promotion while building our team's capacity for future challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>The power of research integration:</strong> The persona insights weren't just user research—they became our strategic foundation for connecting siloed platform capabilities. This reinforced my belief that great design leadership means recognizing when research reveals business strategy, not just user needs.</p>
